# TravelTime
A machine learning model to predict the time needed to travel from one location to another.

## Steps
1.  Read the data and get some primary iformations.
2.  Handle missing values.
3.  Extract features from the date feature.
4.  Encode data using one hot Encoding
5.  Visualise data using Matplotlib
6.  Use kmeans algorithms to gather near locations together and then add a new features "pickup" and "dropoff".
7.  Use a machine learning (XGBRegressor in my case) to train and make predictions.


## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is taken from a public competition on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/).
If you're a dataset owner and do not want your dataset to be included here, please get in touch through a GitHub issue. Thanks for your contribution to the ML community!
